                        More than three years have passed since I began learning HTML, CSS, and JS, and during that time, 
                        I have gained extensive knowledge with both codes and websites. When I was a student at STEM School, 
                        I helped organize lectures on web development languages and participated in designing the school's website, along with a number of other websites covering a wide range of topics.
                        Learning new languages and libraries like Bootstrap, PHP, and SQL has helped me greatly increase my abilities.

                        enhancing languages like the java and the MicroPython. After that, I learnt to use the C and C++ for programming robots. Beside Programming 
                        robots, I learnt many languages like kotlin and ruby to use them in the cyper security. I am now have over +3 years experience in each language.

                      <p>I was introduced to networking during my freshman year in high school. I enrolled in a friend's lesson and got to work on my education. After getting my feet wet dealing with viral machines and expanding my knowledge of networks, I moved on to understanding the ins and outs of Kali Linux and developing methods for gathering intelligence on cyber infrastructure. Finally, with the help of Metaspliotable 2.0, I was able to learn how to identify security flaws, mitigate them, and even exploit them.</p>

                      <p>After competing in FLL for four years and winning first place in the past year's challenge, I decided to start preparing kids for the competition. 
                        In my two years of coaching, I supervised 8 junior coaches. I taught a course on Mindstorms LabView and EV3 robot design to a group of 80+ students.
                        In addition, I coached seven teams in three different national and international championships, including the FLL Arab World Championship.

                        one devoted to Arduino and the other to Lego. I worked with +45 students over the course of 2 years, 
                        holding +15 sessions with each group. Concepts in robotics and electronics were also clarified. After that,

                        I trained for a total of 6 weeks. I developed eight websites from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and JS.  
                        After finishing my training, I went to Helwan University to take part in an IEEE event. 
                        The event was a great opportunity for me to show first-year students some basic information technology principles via examples. After that, 
                        I taught flutter and firebase to 30+ college students at Texos Event and judged 15 projects in the competition.</p>

                A buddy of mine from the College of Computers and Information has always amazed me with his ability to manipulate website elements via the use of code. 
                This is a relationship that goes back more than five years. This sparked a motivation inside me to study computer science and web development. 
                More than three years have passed since I began learning HTML, CSS, and JS, and during that time, 
                I have gained extensive knowledge with both codes and websites. When I was a student at STEM School, 
                I helped organize lectures on web development languages and participated in designing the school's website, along with a number of other websites covering a wide range of topics.
                Learning new languages and libraries like Bootstrap, PHP, and SQL has helped me greatly increase my abilities.

              <p class="s-description text-center">
                At the age of 12, I was introduced to computer programming. To be ready for the FLL competition,
                I enrolled in a programming course that taught me how to use the LabVIEW language. 
                At initially, the robot's motion could be programmed by simply shifting a few bricks to the left and right.
                So I made the conscious decision to further my programming skills. Similar to robotics, I began studying C and C++ in order to utilise Arduino. 
                I have been working on robotics programming for almost six years now. But I also picked up a few more tongues along the way. Some of my projects' implementations are written in Python,
                and I also helped develop a subset of Python specifically for robots. 
                My current goal is to become proficient in more programming languages, including Ruby and Kotlin.

                I was introduced to networking during my freshman year in high school. I spent my time after class attempting to improve my knowledge of networking and cyber security. I enrolled in a friend's lesson and got to work on my education. After getting my feet wet dealing with viral machines and expanding my knowledge of networks, I moved on to understanding the ins and outs of Kali Linux and developing methods for gathering intelligence on cyber infrastructure. Finally, with the help of Metaspliotable 2.0, I was able to learn how to identify security flaws, mitigate them, and even exploit them. Having fallen in love with the industry, I want to continue my studies at a university of my choice to get credentials like the OSCP and CCNA.

                In addition, I coached seven teams in three different national and international championships, including the FLL Arab World Championship.

                holding 15 or more sessions with each group. Concepts in robotics and electronics were also clarified. After that, 
                I set up more than ten workshops where students could learn to construct robots; finally, I helped prepare more than thirty-five students for robotics competitions, 
                and sixteen of them went on to win the All-Egypt MicroMouse Competition.

                After finishing my training, I went to Helwan University to take part in an IEEE event. 
                The event was a great opportunity for me to show first-year students some basic information technology principles via examples. After that,

                I loved working with kids and learning everything I could from them. Throughout my working days, I supervised the kids as they played.
                I helped make meals for the kids, taught them how to play chess, and got them to sketch and colour and play with cubes. Over the course of two months, 
                I was able to get a lot of experience working with kids, which ultimately enabled me to relax and enjoy life more.
